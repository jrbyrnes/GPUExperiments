# GPUExperiments

This is a (very) loosely organized project, that desperately needs some attention. The intention behind this project was to devise a set of "experiments" (i.e. code snippets) which were used to generate execution time data when ran on Host versus ran on Device (tailored for AMD GPU GCN based architecture). The data gathered was then used for a class project.
